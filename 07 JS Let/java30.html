        <h2> Javascript Let</h2>
        <p>Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with 
            <b> var </b> is allowed anywhere in 
            a program: </p>

        <p id="demo"></p>

        <script>

            var x = 2;
            //now x is 2

            var x = 5;
            // finally x is 5

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

        </script>

    </body>
</html>

<!-- the important thing is to write 'var' at correct
place and final -->
